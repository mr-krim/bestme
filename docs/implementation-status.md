## Voice Command System Refactoring Plan

### Current Status
The voice command system has been partially implemented with:
- Basic command detection âœ…
- Command history tracking âœ… 
- Visual feedback for detected commands âœ…
- Configuration system for voice command settings âœ…
- Text editing operations (delete, format) âœ…
- Tauri 2.0 compatibility layer âœ…

### Implementation Plan for Tauri 2.0

#### 1. State Management Refactoring
- Refactor `VoiceCommandState` to remove generic parameters:
```rust
// Current implementation
pub struct VoiceCommandState<R: Runtime = tauri_runtime_wry::Wry<tauri::Wry>> {
    manager: Arc<Mutex<Option<TauriVoiceCommandManager>>>,
    transcribe_state: Option<Arc<TranscribeState<R>>>,
    // other fields...
}

// Tauri 2.0 implementation
pub struct VoiceCommandState {
    manager: Arc<Mutex<Option<TauriVoiceCommandManager>>>,
    app_handle: Option<AppHandle>,
    // other fields...
}
```

- Update state initialization in main.rs to use Tauri 2.0 patterns:
```rust
// Current approach
app.manage(Arc::new(Mutex::new(VoiceCommandState::new())));

// Tauri 2.0 approach
app.manage(VoiceCommandState::new());
```

#### 2. Command Handlers Refactoring
- Simplify command handlers to use the new state access pattern:
```rust
// Current approach
#[tauri::command]
fn get_last_command<R: Runtime>(
    state: tauri::State<'_, Arc<Mutex<VoiceCommandState<R>>>>
) -> Option<CommandData> {
    let state = state.inner().lock();
    state.get_last_command_data()
}

// Tauri 2.0 approach
#[tauri::command]
fn get_last_command(
    state: State<'_, VoiceCommandState>
) -> Option<CommandData> {
    state.get_last_command_data()
}
```

#### 3. Text Editing Commands Implementation
- Add Delete command functionality âœ…
  - Implement detection of phrases like "delete that", "delete last sentence" âœ…
