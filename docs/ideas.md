# Voice Command System Future Ideas

## Feature Enhancements

### Custom User Commands
- Allow users to define their own voice commands
- Provide a UI for mapping custom phrases to actions
- Support binding to system actions (copy, paste, etc.)
- Enable scripting for more complex custom actions

### Command Context Awareness
- Make commands aware of previous transcription context
- Enable commands like "delete previous sentence" or "capitalize last paragraph"
- Implement a context buffer for more sophisticated command execution
- Add command history awareness for relative operations ("undo that twice")

### Voice Command Confirmation
- Add confirmation for destructive commands
- Support for voice-based confirmation ("yes" or "confirm")
- Visual confirmation dialogs for critical operations
- Configurable confirmation levels (high/medium/low risk commands)

### Advanced Pattern Matching
- Implement NLP-based command recognition
- Support for fuzzy matching with confidence scoring
- Command synonyms and alternative phrasings
- Language-specific command patterns

## User Experience Improvements

### Voice Command Training
- Add a training mode to improve recognition for specific users
- Custom voice profile for better accuracy
- Accent adaptation for international users
- Command practice sessions with feedback

### Multi-step Commands
- Support for command sequences and chaining
- Implementation of command macros
- Conditional command execution
- Parameterized commands with variables

### Persistent Command History
- Save command history between sessions
- Provide analytics on most used commands
- Suggest optimizations based on usage patterns
- Command favorites and quick access

### Command Suggestion System
- Contextual command suggestions based on usage patterns
- "Did you know?" tips for unused commands
- Progressive disclosure of advanced commands
- Adaptive command recommendations

## Technical Improvements

### Performance Optimization
- Reduce latency in command processing
