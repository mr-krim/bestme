## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ with Cargo
- Node.js 18+ with npm
- Tauri CLI (`cargo install tauri-cli`)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for cross-platform builds)
- Platform-specific requirements:
  - Windows: Visual Studio Build Tools, WebView2
  - macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools
  - Linux: GTK3, WebKit2GTK, and various development libraries

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bestme.git
   cd bestme
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   cd ui
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

3. Run the application in development mode:
   ```
   cargo tauri dev
   ```

4. For cross-platform builds, use Docker:
   ```
   cd docker
   ./build-all.sh
   ```

## Key Components

### Audio Plugin

The audio plugin (`plugin/audio.rs`) handles device enumeration, audio capture, and level detection. It bridges between the system's audio APIs (via cpal) and the Tauri frontend, providing real-time audio visualization and processing.

### Transcription Plugin

The transcription plugin (`plugin/transcribe.rs`) manages the Whisper speech-to-text functionality, including model management, real-time transcription, and text processing. It supports on-demand model downloading and configurable model storage.

### Configuration System

The configuration system (`config.rs`) handles user preferences, including audio device selection, model choices, and application settings. It persists settings between sessions and provides a clean API for accessing configuration values.

### UI Components

The frontend is built with Svelte and includes:
- Main application window (`App.svelte`) for transcription display
- Settings page (`Settings.svelte`) for configuration
- Audio visualization components
- Model download management interface

## Next Development Steps

Based on the current implementation and the development plan, the following steps are recommended for continued development:

1. **Voice Command System**
   - Implement command detection in the audio processing pipeline
   - Create a grammar system for defining and recognizing commands
   - Add UI feedback for recognized commands
   - Implement text editing operations through voice commands

2. **Language Support**
   - Add language selection in the UI
   - Configure Whisper for multi-language support
   - Implement language auto-detection

3. **Clipboard Integration**
   - Add functionality to copy transcriptions to clipboard
   - Implement auto-copy options
   - Add support for inserting text into active applications

4. **Enhanced UI**
   - Complete dark/light mode support
   - Add platform-specific styling
   - Implement responsive layout for different window sizes
   - Add keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features

5. **Error Handling**
   - Improve error reporting in the UI
   - Add recovery mechanisms for common failures
   - Implement diagnostic logging for troubleshooting

## Build and Release

### Development Builds

For testing during development:
```
cargo tauri dev
```

### Production Builds

For creating production-ready binaries:
```
cargo tauri build
```

### Cross-Platform Builds

For building on all supported platforms:
```
cd docker
./build-all.sh
```

## Testing

Currently, testing is manual. Future development should include:
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for plugins
- UI tests for frontend components
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline

## Documentation

- Code is documented with Rustdoc comments
- User documentation is planned for future development
- Architecture documentation is available in this file and `plan.md`

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Audio device not found**
   - Check system audio settings
   - Ensure microphone permissions are granted
   - Restart the application

2. **Transcription not working**
   - Check if model is downloaded
   - Verify audio levels are registering
   - Check console for error messages

3. **Build errors**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Update Rust and Node.js to latest versions
   - Check platform-specific requirements
