## Development Environment Setup

### Docker-Based Cross-Platform Development ✓
1. **Docker Environment Structure**:
   - `bestme/docker/Dockerfile.windows` - Windows build environment
   - `bestme/docker/Dockerfile.linux` - Linux build environment
   - `bestme/docker/Dockerfile.macos` - macOS build environment
   - `bestme/docker/docker-compose.yml` - Orchestration for all environments

2. **Build Process**:
   - Use `bestme/docker/build-all.sh` to build for all supported platforms
   - Individual platform builds available through specific compose services
   - Incremental builds supported for faster development cycles

3. **Development Workflow**:
   - Develop platform-agnostic code in `core` module
   - Use Docker for Linux and macOS feature development
   - Develop Windows-specific features directly on Windows host
   - Test cross-platform compatibility before each commit

### Local Development Environment
1. **Requirements**:
   - Rust 1.70+ with cargo
   - Node.js 18+ with npm
   - Tauri CLI
   - Platform-specific development tools
     - Windows: VS Build Tools, WebView2
     - macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools
     - Linux: GTK and WebKit development packages

2. **Setup Steps**:
   - Clone repository
   - Run `npm install` in the `bestme/ui` directory
   - Run `cargo install tauri-cli` for Tauri development
   - Start development server with `cargo tauri dev`

## Current Project Status
- Core application framework completed and stable
- Audio capture system operational with device selection
- Whisper transcription integrated with model downloading
- Basic UI implemented with settings page and main view
- System tray integration functional
- Docker-based build environment established
- Code quality improvements with better async patterns and error handling

## Next Steps
1. Complete voice command system as outlined in Phase 8
2. Finalize language selection features
3. Add clipboard integration for transcribed text
4. Enhance platform-specific UI elements
5. Continue improving error handling and recovery

## Technical Requirements
- Rust 1.70+ for backend development
- Node.js 18+ and npm for frontend development
- Tauri 1.4+ for cross-platform capabilities
- Svelte for frontend framework
- WebView2 on Windows, WebKit on macOS/Linux
- Custom plugins for deep system integration

## Conclusion

The BestMe application has made significant progress with a working core system featuring audio capture, real-time visualization, and Whisper-based transcription with on-demand model downloading. The cross-platform architecture using Tauri, Rust, and Svelte provides a solid foundation for further development.

Recent improvements in code quality, error handling, and async patterns have strengthened the foundation of the application, making it more robust and maintainable. The implementation of structured error types, better resource management, and optimized audio processing has set the stage for the upcoming voice command system.

The Docker-based development environment facilitates consistent builds across all target platforms while maintaining native performance characteristics. This hybrid approach allows us to keep complex processing in Rust while leveraging web technologies for a responsive, consistent UI across platforms.

Next development priorities focus on enhancing the user experience with voice commands, additional language support, and platform integration to create a seamless, powerful speech-to-text solution.
